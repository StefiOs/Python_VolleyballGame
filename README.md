# Python_VolleyballGame

In this project, the user is a scoretaker. In volleyball, there are 5 matches in a game. A volleyball league would like a
program that will accept the number of points that each team scores in the 5 matches and print out the
data along with the winner. The winning team is that one that wins the most matches. 
Note: It is not necessarily the team that scores the most number of points. 

This program makes use of:
* Print fuctions
* Variables
* Eval input fuctions
* If/else statements
* Functions
* String formatting operations
